# HuntBot

My exploration in connecting OpenAI Assistant function calling to my sites routing and other functions.

I'm documenting this project on Notion. Invite only [request access here](https://www.notion.so/hunterbryant/HuntGPT-7deb24a1ff044f4eafe30146493cd7df?pvs=4)

## Developing

Initially built with ['create-svelte']
Create a project and installed dependencies with `pnpm install`, start a development server:

```bash
pnpm run dev

# or start the server and open the app in a new browser tab
pnpm run dev -- --open
```

## Building

To create a production version of your app:

```bash
npm run build
```

You can preview the production build with `npm run preview`.
